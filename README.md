# Simple Reddit-bot project:

## Current functionality:
- Trawls the latest posts on Overwatch University subreddit to return guides related to a defined list of heroes; outputs those guides to terminal
- Uses the PRAW API

## To Do:
- Improve flexibility of user defined heroes/categories
- Use a library for more robust/fuzzy string matching to account for spelling mistakes in titles
- Add articles to database for later access
- Change from terminal output to some other form of web notifications
- Set up so can be run as a script on a server/RPi
- Language processing to differentiate questions from guides
